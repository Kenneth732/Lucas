## Installation

```bash
npm install lucas-ui-components
# or
yarn add lucas-ui-components
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { QuantumNav, HolographicTestimonial } from 'quantum-ui-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <QuantumNav />
      <HolographicTestimonial 
        name="JANE ENTANGLEMENT"
        title="QUANTUM FOUNDER"
        feedback="Our metrics improved by 284% across all dimensions!"
        energy={92}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Customization

Quantum UI components can be customized using CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --quantum-primary: #00f0ff;
  --quantum-secondary: #ff00f0;
  --quantum-accent: #96ff32;
  --quantum-bg: #050210;
  --quantum-text: #e0e0e0;
}
```

## Dependencies

- React 18+
- GSAP (for animations)
- React Router (for navigation components)

## Browser Support

Quantum UI supports all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with full animation capabilities. Some effects may be simplified in older browsers.
